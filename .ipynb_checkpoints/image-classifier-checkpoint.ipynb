    "# Image Classification Using Tensorflow\n",
    "Hello, Rhoam here, gonna go through image classification. This one looks pretty easy I guess. Saw Siraj's video and it looks promising. I'm gonna try and lay out absolutely everything that I've done so that maybe it can help somebody out... unless I'm the only one reading this and its all just for shits and giggles lololol \n",
